This is the code repository for the Digits web app.
Made by Abel Batalla.

This has been the result of my final degree project.

## Abstract
The aim of this project is the creation of a web application that implements the Digits program, a training tool designed to improve arithmetic skills in children, whose effectiveness has been proven in previous studies. The project has been developed from scratch, implementing both the Digits program and the software system necessary for its operation, in addition to added functionalities such as user management and the collection and visualization of personal performance data in the training done with Digits.
This work documents the entire development process, from conceptualization to final implementation, including technical decisions, system architecture, technologies employed, and algorithms used. The resulting website can be accessed via the following link: https://numericalcognition.net.
